# Raspberry-pi-enabled-watering-system

These scripts enables to automate the garden watering using Raspberry pi and Arduino Nano. It will features soon a cron job schedules 40s of water every two days a week. The job outcome is sent by email via SMTP. -- an Arduino Nano samples very 20m the soil moisture of the plants, just because I like to chart it to see the moisture of the soil.

This is ongoing development since 2020 (Busy and sometimes lazy days) and I'm planning to use Zerotier to access my raspberry pi remotely outside of my LAN. This will work smoothly soon.
